//
// It's measured from how the hand starts, as it's shown in the hand check: turning it away from that, whichever way
// round it was, is turning it over, so a hand that rests the other way round still has to turn to play. Two things
// in the tracker's points say how far it has gone. How wide the knuckles look, for how long the palm is, which
// narrows as the hand turns side-on and widens again as the other side comes round. And which side of the hand
// faces the camera, from which way round the first and little fingers' knuckles are from the wrist, which swaps as
// it passes side-on. The tracker names the hand rightly from either side.
//
// Turning back always counts at once. Turned over is what pours, so the reading is slow to say a hand has gone
// past side-on and quick to say it has come back: back on its starting side, a fainter look is enough, and the
// tracker's own 3D points, if they clearly face the camera the way the hand started, overrule a hand that only looks
// the other way round.
//
// No DOM and no camera here, so it runs against real hands from photos in test/unit/turn.test.js.
