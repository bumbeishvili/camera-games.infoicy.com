// What playing with friends looks like, in every game that can be played with them: a box on the title card for
// making or joining a race, a flight, a game, a fight or a battle, the screen for waiting at the start, and how
// everyone did on the finish card. Each game gives its own words, and what's sent and shown about each friend. The connection
// itself is in friends.js.
//
// Once the box is open, by its button or a friend's link, the title card shows nothing else, over the game
// dimmed and blurred behind it: making a game, or typing a friend's 3-letter code, which joins as soon as it's
// typed. Then the code, who's here, a name if they'd like one, and the game's own start button, moved in under
// them. Back, or leaving, goes back to the usual title card.
