// Whether the hand in play is held up, as for a high five, for a game played by showing the hand to something, as
// Giraffe's Goal is: its fingers up, or out to the side, rather than hanging down, and the hand not tipped over
// towards the camera. With hemiplegia the wrist drops as the fingers open, and many children can only open the hand
// that way. A hand that's open and held up like this has its wrist straight, or bent back, which no other game asks
// for.
//
// Two things in the tracker's points say so, both from the picture. Which way the palm points, from the wrist to the
// middle finger's knuckle. And how wide the knuckles look for how long the palm is: a hand tipped towards the
// camera, or away from it, looks shorter and just as wide. Hands held flat to the camera measured 0.66 to 0.77, and
// a photo of one squeezed to 70% of its height, as a hand tipped 46° looks, read as tipped 40° to 48°. The reading
// stops rising at about 60°, so a limit has to be well under that. The tracker's 3D points are no use for this: for
// the same flat hands they read anything from 5° to 40° of tip.
//
// How flat is flat is the hand's own, from how it's shown in the hand check, if that's in the range real hands have.
// A child whose wrist drops will often make the hand check that way too, and that looks wider than any flat hand
// does, so then it's the usual hand's, and the wrist still has to come up. A dropped hand reads 54° to 61° then,
// which is as far as the reading goes, so a little held up has to be well under that. A check made with the hand
// turned side-on looks narrower than any flat hand, and that's the usual hand's too.
//
// No DOM and no camera here, so it runs against real hands from photos in test/unit/upright.test.js.
