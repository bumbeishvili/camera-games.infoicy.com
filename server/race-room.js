// The same rules run on Cloudflare (server/worker.js) and on this computer for the tests

// A player sends JSON messages, each { t, ... }:

//                                      In Giraffe's Maze, length is how many mazes, and mode their size and seed,

//                                      In The Lighthouse Keeper, length is how many ships there are to bring home,
//                                      and in Giraffe's Garden how many plants there are to grow.
