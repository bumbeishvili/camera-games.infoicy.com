// Gobble and Grow: the child is a tiny creature that grows by eating, from a bacterium to a galaxy, one world to
// each level. It's played with the mouth: opening it wide gobbles whatever small thing is in reach, and shutting it
// munches. Opening the mouth wide and closing it again is what children with one weaker side of the face find
// hard, and core/face/mouth.js says whether it's open, measured against the child's own widest. The creature goes
// where the child's face goes, or swims to the food by itself if a grown-up chooses the mouth alone. On their own,
// or with friends: eating from one soup to grow together, or each in their own to see who grows up first.
// The rules are in rules.js, the worlds in worlds.js, and it's drawn by view.js and art.js.
