// The rules of a run. No screen, camera or sound in this file: moves come in and what happened
// comes out as events, so all of it runs in the unit tests.
//
// The trail is laid out ahead of time. Jumping is the only move asked for: there are no squats, so a
// child never has to wonder which move is wanted. There's a stretch of trail before each obstacle
// where a jump counts, and a jump anywhere in that stretch clears it, however early it is. The
// fighter just hangs in the air for longer. The trail has three lanes. Most obstacles go right across
// and need a jump, but some only fill one or two lanes, and those can be passed by stepping into a
// free lane as well as by jumping them, which is what makes moving across worth it. Lines of stars
// are in one lane or another, often the free one. Nobody loses here. Missing a jump either stops the
// fighter to wait for it, or costs a stumble, and a missed star costs nothing.
//
// Each level, from 1 to 10, is a little harder than the one before: see trailLevel below.
//
// Running with friends, everyone runs the same trail, laid out from the same seed: the host's level, pace,
// length and lanes, with its obstacles and lines of stars, but none of the extras a level adds, which would
// each need sharing out. A star on the trail is only had by one runner: whoever the server says got to it
// first. The stars for clearing an obstacle are each runner's own.
