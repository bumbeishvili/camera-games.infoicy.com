// The story and rules of Tank Patrol. Robot tanks are rolling into Giraffe's valley, and he's riding in the
// child's tank to stop them. The hand is a pointer: a closed hand drives the tank to where it points,
// and an open hand swings the turret there, and the gun fires by itself at any robot tank under it that
// is in range. Closing to drive nearer and opening to fire is the exercise, and that's how it's won.
//
// A hand that's missing, out of the picture or can't be read does nothing at all: it doesn't fire and
// it doesn't drive. If it's gone for a moment or stays the same for a few seconds, that's a rest, and the
// robots stop and wait. There's no screen, sound or camera in this file, so it all runs in the unit tests.
