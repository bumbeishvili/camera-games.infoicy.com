// Tank Patrol together with a friend: two children, each on their own computer with their own camera, each of
// them one of two tanks side by side in the same valley, stopping the robot tanks between them.
//
// The robot tanks have to be the same on both screens, and they go by where the children's tanks are, so one
// game runs them: the game of whoever made the patrol. Ten times a second it tells the friend's game where each
// one is, how many hits it has left and what shells are coming over (wire). The friend's game shows them
// (follow), and drives and fires its own tank just as it would by itself. A shot that reaches a robot tank is a
// hit, decided by the game that fired it, as that's the one its child is looking at. The friend's game shows its
// own hits at once and tells the host's game (a 'tag'), which counts them (friendTagged).
//
// It's the plain patrol, with none of what the levels bring, on Gentle, so the shells are slow and nobody can
// lose, and with twice the robot tanks, as there are two tanks to stop them. Shells come for each tank in turn,
// never for one whose child is resting, and the robot tanks only stop and wait when both children are resting.
// A friend who goes leaves the other to finish by themselves, with half of what was left. If the friend was the
// one running the robot tanks, the game still here takes them over as they are.
//
// What the two tanks share with a battle against each other is in pair.js. There's no screen, sound or camera in
// this file, so it all runs in the unit tests.
