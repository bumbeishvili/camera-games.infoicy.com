// Cannon Bay together with a friend: two children, each on their own computer with their own camera, each
// sailing one of two ships side by side against the pirates.
//
// The pirates have to be the same on both screens, and they go by where the children's ships are, so one game
// runs them: the game of whoever made the battle. About ten times a second it tells the friend's game where
// each pirate ship is, how many hits it has left and what cannonballs are in the air (wire). The friend's game
// shows them (follow), and sails and fires its own ship just as it would by itself. A ball that reaches a
// pirate ship is a hit, decided by the game that fired it, as that's the one its child is looking at. The
// friend's game shows its own hits at once and tells the host's game (a 'tag'), which counts them
// (friendTagged). Each game decides whether a pirate's ball lands on its own child's ship.
//
// It's the plain battle, with none of what the levels bring, and the pirates are as on Gentle, so nobody can be
// sunk. Each child keeps their own firing zones and help with lining up. There are as many pirate ships as the
// host chose, each taking twice the hits, as there are two ships firing at it, with one more about at a time.
// Every other pirate goes for the friend's ship, and none goes for a child who's resting while the other sails
// on: the pirates only sail in circles and wait when both children are resting. A friend who goes leaves the
// other to finish by themselves, with half the hits still to make. If theirs was the game running the pirates,
// the game still here takes them over as they are.
//
// There's no screen, camera or sound in this file, so it all runs in the unit tests.
