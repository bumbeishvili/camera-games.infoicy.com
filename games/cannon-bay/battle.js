// Pirates have come for the island's treasure, and the child's ship drives them off. One hand does
// everything. Moving it from side to side turns the wheel. Opening it raises the sails, and the wider
// it's open the faster the ship goes, which is the sustained opening being practised. Closing it lowers
// them, and the ship slows and drifts, and that's never a failure.
//
// The cannons fire by themselves, at any pirate ship in the firing zone on either side, as ships fire
// from their sides. They only fire with the hand seen to be open, unless a grown-up has set them to
// fire always, and even then only with the hand in view. Pirates hunt the child's ship and turn side on
// to fire slow cannonballs in high arcs. Nobody gets hurt: a beaten ship lowers its sails and slowly
// sinks, and its crew rows away in a lifeboat. A hand that's gone or stays closed is a rest: the
// pirates stop firing and sail in circles, and nothing bad can happen.
