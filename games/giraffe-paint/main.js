// Giraffe's Paint Box: Giraffe is painting pictures for the friends' party, and the child colours them in. The open
// hand is the brush: paint goes down where it moves, inside the lines, and dipping it in a paint pot takes that paint.
// A closed hand is the brush lifted. It practises opening the hand and keeping it open while moving it smoothly
// across the picture. The rules are in paint.js, the pictures in pages.js, and the sheet is drawn by view.js. On
// their own, or with friends, each on their own computer: all painting one sheet together, or each their own, to
// see who finishes first.
