// Giraffe's Paint Box: Giraffe is painting pictures for the friends' party, and the child colours them in. The open
// hand is the brush: paint goes down where it moves, and never over the lines. A closed hand, or one that can't be
// seen, is the brush lifted: nothing happens, and nothing is lost. Dipping the open hand in a paint pot takes that
// paint. Each part of a picture has a dot of the colour it asks for, and once a part is mostly painted it fills
// itself in. Every part painted, the picture is done.
//
// The rules are here, with no screen, so they run in the unit tests. main.js says where the hand is and whether it's
// open, and view.js draws what this says. Places are on the sheet (pages.js): 150 across and 100 down, with the row
// of paint pots under it. Nothing has a time limit and nothing goes away: a resting child comes back to the picture
// just as they left it.
//
// How much of a part is painted is counted on a grid of little squares, one for each unit of the sheet: 150 by 100.
// Each square belongs to the part that's on top there, and is painted or not. The screen draws the real brush
// strokes, cut to each part's shape; the squares are only for counting.
//
// With friends, either everyone paints the same sheet together, each on their own computer, or each paints their own
// copy, to see who finishes first. Together, each game sends the strokes its child paints, as a few numbers, and
// paints the ones that come from the others, so every sheet ends up the same. Whoever's stroke finishes a part
// claims it, and the server says whose it is, the first to claim it having it.
