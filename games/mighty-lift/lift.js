// The rules of Mighty Lift. No screen, camera or sound in this file: how high each arm is comes in, and
// what happened comes out as events, so all of it runs in the unit tests.
//
// Someone is stuck under something heavy, and the child lifts it off them. Raising the arm raises the
// weight, as high as the arm goes, and held above a line for a moment, the friend scrambles out. Letting
// it down early only lowers the weight again: what the friend has already managed is kept, nobody is
// hurt, and nothing has a time limit. Then the weight comes down with the arm, and the next friend needs
// help. A game is so many lifts, as a grown-up chose, never a race against a clock.
//
// How high is high enough is the child's own. Each arm has its own line: as high as a grown-up chose, but
// never more than most of the way to the highest that arm reached in the warm-up, and it comes down to
// meet a child who's trying. Each level, from 1 to 10, brings something new: see liftLevel below.
//
// With friends, everyone lifts one big weight together, each arm adding its share, or each frees their own
// friends and the most wins: see Lifting's team.
