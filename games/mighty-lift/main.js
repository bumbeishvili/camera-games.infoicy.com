// Mighty Lift: someone is stuck under something heavy, and the child lifts it off them by raising an arm. The
// weight goes as high as the arm does, and held up for a moment, the friend scrambles free. It's the game about
// raising the arm, to the shoulder and on above the head, and holding it there. This file runs it from start to
// finish, on top of what the body games share in core/body/game.js. The rules are in lift.js and the yard is
// in world.js.
//
// Friends can lift together, each on their own computer: everyone on one big weight, each arm adding its share,
// or each freeing their own friends, to see who frees the most.
