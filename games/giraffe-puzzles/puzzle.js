// Giraffe's Puzzles: Giraffe's picture fell off the wall and broke into pieces, and the child puts it back together.
// The pieces lie on a board at each side, with the empty frame on Giraffe's easel in the middle. An open hand over a
// loose piece picks it up, and the piece goes with the hand for as long as it stays open. Brought near its place, it
// snaps in. A hand that closes, or can't be seen, just leaves the piece where it is: nothing is lost, and nothing has
// to be gripped. Keeping the hand open while reaching to every part of the picture is what's practised.
//
// The rules are here, with no screen, so they run in the unit tests. main.js says where the glove is and whether the
// hand is open, and view.js draws what this says. Places are in table units: the table is TABLE.width wide and 1 high,
// x across from the left and y down from the top, the same on every screen. Nothing in a puzzle has a time limit and
// nothing goes away: a resting child comes back to it just as they left it.
//
// With friends, together, everyone works on the same puzzle, each on their own computer. A hand that comes to a
// loose piece claims it, and the server says whose each claim is (claimed), the first having it, so a piece one
// child holds can't be taken by another. Each game tells the others which piece it holds, and where the pieces it
// last held now lie, so every computer shows the same puzzle. Against each other, each has a copy of the same
// puzzle to themselves, and only how far they've got goes to the others.
