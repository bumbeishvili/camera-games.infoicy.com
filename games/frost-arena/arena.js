//
// A small snowy yard with crates and containers to fight round, a team at each end, and a match of tag with
// rifles: the player's team in blue, with Giraffe on it, against the computer's in red. It's seen through the
// player's own eyes, and played the way a shooter is played with two thumbs on a phone, with two hands in the air
// instead: one hand on a stick, to walk, sidestep, back away and sprint, and the other looking round, with its
// trigger. What the hands are asking for is worked out in controls.js. Here it's what a match makes of it.
//
// Shots go where the sights are, and nowhere else: each one is a line from the player's eye, a little way off
// the middle of the sights by how steady the rifle is. It's steadiest standing still with the first shot, and
// opens up with every shot after it, with walking, and most of all with sprinting, and the rifle kicks the view
// up as it fires. There are magazines without end, but each holds thirty rounds, and changing one takes a moment.
//
// Nobody gets hurt. A player who's been hit enough is tagged out: they sit down, and are back at their own end a
// few seconds later. The player's team wins with the number of tags chosen, and the other team, on Medium and
// Tough, by tagging the player that many times. With neither hand in the picture it's paused: everyone the
// computer plays stops and waits, and nothing can happen.
