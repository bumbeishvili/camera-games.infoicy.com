// Frost Arena: a team match of tag with rifles in a snowy yard, seen through the player's own eyes. Blue, with
// Giraffe on it, against the computer's red. It's a shooter for players who know shooters, played with two hands in
// the air the way one is played with two thumbs on the glass of a phone. A closed hand is a thumb lifted, and does
// nothing. A hand that opens is a thumb put down where it opens, and dragged from there: the hand that isn't in
// play walks, sidesteps, backs away and sprints, and the hand in play looks round. A thumb held up fires on the
// hand in play, and changes the magazine on the other, with the drag still going. Both are drawn on the screen as
// they are on a phone, a pad and its knob at the bottom on each side, with the buttons beside them, so it's always
// plain what each hand is doing, and both are drawn on the camera's picture as the tracker sees them. What fires,
// changes the magazine and sprints can each be given to something else a hand can do with its fingers, on either
// hand, under the gear icon.
//
// With friends, each on their own computer, up to four are in the same yard: together on the blue team against
// the computer's red team (team.js), or everyone for themselves (rivals.js), as whoever made the match chooses.
// See core/friends-ui.js for making and joining one.
//
// How the hands are read is in controls.js, the rules are in arena.js, and the picture is in yard.js.
