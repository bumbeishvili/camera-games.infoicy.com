// Giraffe's Garden: Giraffe's garden has dried up in the sun, and the child waters it back to life with his watering

// grows, and flowers once it has had enough, and once every one is in flower, the bees come to the party.

// time: each game claims the sips its child's can pours, and the server says whose each one is (claimed), the first
// to claim it having it. A plant grows by every sip anyone got, so it grows the same on every computer, flowers on
// all of them at once, and two children watering it grow it twice as fast.
