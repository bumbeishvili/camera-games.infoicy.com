// The story and rules of Robot Rescue. Robots have caught the friends from the other games and locked
// them up all over town. The child rides a little tram from place to place. An open hand fires at
// whatever is in the crosshair, and a closed hand raises a shield and reloads. Clearing the robots
// from a place frees the friend who's locked up there. There's no screen in this file, so it runs in
// the unit tests.
//
// Everything is in metres: x to the right of the tram, z straight ahead of it and y up, all measured
// from where the tram stops at that place.
