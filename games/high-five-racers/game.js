// The race: the player's car and the others on the road, the big hands to slap, stars to catch and
// ramps to jump, and the camera following it all. The world itself is in world.js.
//
// The car follows the road by itself and steering only moves it across the road, so nobody can
// crash or get stuck. There is no failing here on purpose. The one thing that matters is `drive`,
// which comes straight from the hand monitor and is 0 unless the hand in play is open.
//
// Nothing flashes or strobes: seizures are more common in children with hemiplegia, so road markings
// are low contrast and long, there are no full-screen effects, and the tunnel is as bright as outdoors.
// Anything that happens is a burst of small shapes where it happened.
//
// Each level (rules.js, racePlan) brings more cars, more big hands and ramps, and keener racing, and from
// level 2 something new each time: coins, power-ups, a tractor, a sunset, a balloon with a gem, a treasure
// chest, a shower of rain and a giant high ten at the finish. Those are in extras.js and weather.js.
