// Arrow Meadow: it's the meadow fair, and Giraffe is in the archery contest. The child holds his bow with one hand
// and his bowstring with the other: the bow hand, up or down, tilts the bow, the hands going apart draw it, and
// opening the string hand lets the arrow fly. It goes in an arc, and a dotted line shows where, so nothing is a
// guess. Enough targets hit win the contest.
//
// The rules are here, with no screen, camera or sound, so they run in the unit tests. bow.js says what the two hands
// are asking for, main.js passes it on, and view.js draws what this says. The meadow is seen from the side. Places
// are in screen heights, x from the edge behind the archer and y down from the top, so the meadow is WORLD.wide
// across and 1 high, whatever the screen: view.js fits it in, and turns it round for the hand in play.
//
// Nothing here can be lost, and nothing is taken away. An arrow that misses costs nothing, the next one is ready at
// once, and nothing waits for a child who's resting: every target is still there when they come back. A plain straw
// target always stands near, whatever else the level has brought, and after a few misses in a row it grows.
//
// With friends, each on their own computer: together, everyone has the same targets, laid out the same from one
// seed, and each game claims the ones its own arrows hit. The server says whose each one is (claimed), the first to
// claim it having it, so every game counts the same. Against each other, everyone has the same targets in a lane of
// their own, one after another, and the first to enough of them wins.
