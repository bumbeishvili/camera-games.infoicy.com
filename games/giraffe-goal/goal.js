// Giraffe's Goal: the cup final has gone to penalties, and Giraffe's team needs a goalkeeper. The child is in goal,
// looking out at the pitch. A kicker runs up and shoots, a ring shows where the ball is coming, and the child's glove
// saves it by being there, with the hand open and held up like a high five. Enough saves win the match.
//
// The rules are here, with no screen, so they run in the unit tests. main.js says where the glove is and whether the
// hand is ready to save (open, and held up: see core/upright.js), and view.js draws what this says. Places are in
// shares of the screen, x across from the left and y down from the top, and sizes and distances are in screen
// heights.
//
// Nothing here can be lost, and nothing is taken away. A ball that goes in costs nothing: the match is won by
// saves, however many shots it takes. A kicker only runs up once the hand is ready to save, so every shot starts
// with the hand open and held up, and a resting child comes back to a kicker who has waited. And after a ball goes
// in, the next ones come slower and nearer the glove.
//
// The balls go where they do on purpose: near the hand, far out to its own side, across the middle of the picture
// to the other side, which is reaching across the body, and up high.
